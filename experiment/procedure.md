### Procedure

- Step1: Select one of the example sample audio/waveforms file and click on the 'Generate Spectrum' button.

- Step2: Study the effect of NFFT points on the spectrum.

- Step3: Study the effect of windowing by choosing various window functions.

- Step4: Recompute the spectrum by selecting different lengths (5 ms, 10 ms and 50 ms) of the speech signal.

- Step5: Compare the spectra for two different window shapes using the two spectrum panels provided.

- Step6: Study the short-time spectrum for different category of sounds such as fricatives, nasals, semivowels, vowels and stops.

- Step7: Write a brief note on the observations.
